			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a new reaction mechanic that allows reaction to occur in an incremental fashion. This uses temperature to determine reaction rate and pH to determine purity. The hotter it is, the faster it reacts. Keeping your pH within the range (default 5-9) will keep it pure, with the further out you are affecting your purity. Reactions are also H+ consuming/producing and exo/endothermic.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds purity mechanics for reactions - if a purity extremely low at the end of a reaction then it will convert into viscous sludge or a failed chem. When a reagent is consumed; If a reagent is very impure it will inverse into another chem. This inversion will remove all of the original chem and take its place instead. If it's slightly impure then it will split into an impure chem with respect to purity. The ratio of original to impure is determined by the purity of the original when consumed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the following basic impure reagents to accommodate the changes above: Chemical isomers, Toxic sludge and Viscous sludge.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acidic and basic buffers. These will self-consume when added to a reagent holder will other reagents in it, and alter the pH towards their respective extreme. Thereby altering the pH without affecting the volume. adds; Optional catalysts - these reagents will speed up the reaction of a certain type. Presently Palladium synthate catalyst exists and works on medicine reagents only.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Competitive reactions - Tempomyocin and Purity tester are reactions that compete based off temperature. Tempomyocin is a reagent that will instantly speed up a reaction based off its purity and the purity tester reagent will fizzle if the solution it is added to has anything impure in it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds an overheat/impure mechanic during reactions - overheating your reaction past it's overheat point will reduce the yield of your product by 2% per tick, with some reactions having special explosions instead. If overly impure it will reduce the purity of all reagents present in the beaker.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">1 dropper and 1 bottle of acidic buffer (you can make this) to the chemist's locker. Gives chemists a starting dropper and random buffer. Added pH booklets to the chemists chemdrobe - these can tell you the pH of a beaker by ripping a sheet out of them and using it on a beaker or reagent holder</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a pH meter than can be researched and printed from the med lathe. When used on a reagent holder it will tell you a detailed breakdown of the reagents in the beaker, including pH, volume and purity. It will also detect ongoing reactions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds pH to all reagents - the pH of a beaker/holder will be the sum of all reagents with respect to volume. pH is an abstracted potential of hydrogen that affects reactions.</li>
				<li class="tweak">heavily edited the chem heater into a reaction chamber, showing multiple details on a reaction, edited chem master and chem dispenser’s UI to show pH.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now use droppers and syringes directly on heaters to affect the beaker inside of it (provided there’s a beaker in there)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaks most reagents to use a default handler. The ones omitted are ones that rely on being instant. This default has a minimum reaction temperature of 100, an optimal temperature of 500 and an overheat temperature of 900+. Their optimal pH range is 5-9; which will result in a purity 1 reagent when kept within this window. If the reaction is within a pH window of 1-4 or 9-13 the resulting purity will be dependent on the deviation from 5 or 9. <1 or >14 will create impure chems for every step. If your final purity on the end of a reaction is less than 0.15, then it will collapse into Viscous sludge. The reaction is mildly exothermic and H+ consuming.</li>
				<li class="tweak">tweaks chocolate milk, firefighting foam and hercuri reactions to work better with the new mechanics. These inherit the same pH windows as above but are cold reactions instead.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">added several sound effects for chemistry</li>
				<li class="imageadd">added melting beaker icons, pHbooklets and pHmeters</li>
				<li class="code_imp">changed reagents code, created equilibrium.dm</li>
